# x-tunnel Development Plan Until 2026-05-16 19:00 +07

Assumption: "today 7 o'clock" means 19:00 on 2026-05-16 in the current local timezone (+07). Current planning time: about 03:33, leaving roughly 15.5 hours.

## Objective

Improve x-tunnel from a working single-file prototype into a protocol that is easier to evolve, verify, debug, and harden without breaking current WS/WSS + smux + SOCKS5/HTTP/TCP forwarding behavior.

## Current Baseline

- Single Go binary in `x-tunnel.go` with client/server modes.
- Transports: `ws://`, `wss://`, optional ECH, smux multiplexing.
- Local client listeners: SOCKS5, HTTP proxy, TCP forward.
- Remote egress: direct TCP/UDP or upstream SOCKS5.
- Existing manual verification previously passed local SOCKS5 and TCP forwarding.
- Main gap: no automated test files, no protocol spec, and protocol messages are implicit in code.

## Time-Boxed Plan

### Phase 1: Protocol Spec and Risk Map, 03:35-05:00

- [x] Document current wire protocol in `docs/protocol.md`.
- [x] Define frame/header formats for stream open, TCP, UDP chunk, UDP reply, and ping.
- [x] Record current limits: target length <= 65535, chunk length <= 65535, TLS 1.3, token via WebSocket subprotocol.
- [x] Identify backward-compatibility constraints before changing bytes on the wire.
- [x] List concrete risks: missing version negotiation, weak error propagation, no automated parser fuzz tests, large single-file maintenance cost, limited graceful shutdown.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] Manual review that spec matches existing parser/writer functions.

### Phase 2: Test Harness First, 05:00-07:00

- [x] Add unit tests for `parseIPStrategy`.
- [x] Add unit tests for SOCKS5 auth/address parsing.
- [x] Add round-trip tests for `writeSmuxOpenHeader` and `readSmuxOpenHeader`.
- [x] Add round-trip tests for `writeChunk` and `readChunk`.
- [x] Add round-trip tests for `writeUDPReply` and `readUDPReply`.
- [x] Add round-trip and malformed-input tests for SOCKS5 UDP packet parsing/building.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] Add coverage around protocol parser edge cases.

### Phase 3: Protocol Evolution Foundation, 07:00-09:30

- [x] Add a versioned client/server hello on each smux session or stream without breaking current data paths.
- [x] Define capability flags for TCP, UDP, ping, IP strategy, and future compression/metrics.
- [x] Fail cleanly on unsupported versions/capabilities.
- [x] Keep compatibility path for existing behavior if possible; otherwise document the breaking point clearly.

Verification:

- [x] Unit tests for supported and unsupported version negotiation.
- [x] Local WS server/client tunnel smoke test.

### Phase 4: Reliability and Lifecycle, 09:30-12:00

- [x] Replace repeated magic timeout literals with config fields where practical.
- [x] Add listener/server context plumbing where it can be done without a large rewrite.
- [x] Improve reconnect backoff to avoid fixed retry storms.
- [x] Ensure goroutines exit on stream/session close in TCP and UDP paths.
- [x] Add clearer error logs for failed TCP/UDP target dial/open.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] Local connectivity smoke test for SOCKS5 and TCP forward.
- [x] Short reconnect test by killing/restarting local server.

### Phase 5: Security Hardening, 12:00-14:00

- [x] Add explicit config validation for listener and forward URLs.
- [x] Add safer token validation semantics and document token limitations.
- [x] Add optional target allow/deny CIDR or host rules if the scope stays small.
- [x] Review `-insecure`, fallback, and ECH interactions; make user-facing logs unambiguous.
- [x] Document recommended deployment modes.

Verification:

- [x] Tests for config validation and auth failure behavior where practical.
- [x] Manual unauthorized token test.

### Phase 6: Observability and Operator UX, 14:00-15:30

- [x] Add structured-ish log prefixes or counters for sessions, channels, streams, reconnects, and UDP associations.
- [x] Add a `-version` flag if build metadata can be added simply.
- [x] Improve help text and README examples for common modes.
- [x] Add a troubleshooting section for token mismatch, ECH failure, DNS failure, and no smux channel available.

Verification:

- [x] `go run . -h`
- [x] README/docs examples checked against actual flags.

### Phase 7: Refactor Only Where It Pays, 15:30-17:30

- [x] Extract pure protocol encoding/decoding into a small file/package if tests show a clean boundary.
- [x] Extract SOCKS5 parsing/building helpers if it reduces single-file risk without broad churn.
- [x] Avoid broad architectural rewrites unless current changes become hard to verify.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] `go run . -h`
- [x] Local WS server/client tunnel smoke test.

### Phase 8: Final Verification and Review, 17:30-19:00

- [x] Run complete local test matrix:
  - [x] server `ws://127.0.0.1`
  - [x] client SOCKS5 listener
  - [x] client TCP forward listener
  - [x] HTTP proxy CONNECT if feasible in time
  - [x] token mismatch rejection
- [x] Record exact commands and results in this file.
- [x] Review diff for unnecessary churn.
- [x] Confirm docs match current behavior.
- [x] Prepare final summary with remaining risks and next development backlog.

## Scope Control Rules

- Do not change wire bytes before tests exist for the current format.
- Prefer compatibility and explicit negotiation over silent behavior changes.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible; no broad rewrite unless a narrower fix is blocked.
- If tests fail or protocol behavior is ambiguous, stop and re-plan before continuing.

## Candidate Backlog After 19:00

- QUIC/WebTransport transport option.
- [x] Metrics endpoint or Prometheus counters.
- [x] Config file support.
- [x] mTLS or stronger client authentication.
- Benchmark suite and load testing.
- [x] Windows/Linux/macOS release packaging.
- [x] CI workflow.
- [x] Automated local integration test.
- [x] Release build metadata script.
- [x] Protocol helper benchmarks.

## Review

Pending for later phases: reliability/security changes, integration smoke tests, and final review.

Phase 4:

- Added config fields for reconnect max delay/jitter, DNS query timeout, ECH retry delay, UDP read timeout, and shutdown timeout.

Phase 7:

- Extracted protocol constants and pure protocol encoders/decoders into `protocol.go`.
- Kept SOCKS5 helpers in `x-tunnel.go` for now because they are still interleaved with listener and UDP relay behavior; extracting them now would be churn without a cleaner boundary.
- Verified with `go test ./...`: pass.
- Verified with `go test -cover ./...`: pass, `coverage: 15.7% of statements`.
- Verified `go run . -h` and `go run x-tunnel.go protocol.go -h`: pass and includes `-version` and `socks5://`.

- CONNECT evidence: response contained `s_server -quiet -accept 19443`.
- Token rejection evidence: client logged `认证失败：Token 不匹配或未提供`; server logged `Token 认证失败，来源 IP: 127.0.0.1`.
- Diff review: protocol extraction is isolated to `protocol.go`; no wire-format changes were made in Phase 7/8.
- Docs checked: `README.md`, `docs/protocol.md`, `docs/deployment.md`, and `docs/troubleshooting.md` match the current flags and observed behavior.

- `go test -run 'Test(Socks5HandshakeHandlesProgressiveShortWrites|UpstreamSOCKS5WritersRejectShortWrites|Socks5UserPassAuthSrvHandlesProgressiveShortWrites|Socks5ConnectHandlesProgressiveShortWrites|ProtocolWritersRejectShortWritesWithoutError|WriteAllHandlesProgressiveShortWrites)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 51.2% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Upstream SOCKS5 request writers now use `writeAll`, so progressive short writes are completed and silent short writes fail with `io.ErrShortWrite`.
- Focused short-write regressions plus full, coverage, and race suites passed.

Post Phase 8 local proxy response short-write handling:

- [x] Add local SOCKS5 response writer helpers for method selection, auth replies, fixed command replies, and UDP ASSOCIATE replies.
- [x] Use `writeAll` for local SOCKS5 method selection, auth, CONNECT failure/success, unsupported command, and UDP ASSOCIATE responses.

- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 53.4% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Local SOCKS5 and HTTP proxy responses now complete progressive short writes and expose silent short writes as `io.ErrShortWrite` through shared helpers.
- UDP ASSOCIATE replies now validate the response address and port before writing the protocol frame.

Post Phase 8 SOCKS5 UDP target-policy integration:

- [x] Reuse the SOCKS5 UDP integration setup so success and no-response cases share the same handshake path.
- [x] Assert a blocked SOCKS5 UDP target produces no UDP response.
- [x] Assert blocked UDP increments `x_tunnel_server_target_rejections_total` and logs `UDP 拒绝`.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'TestIntegrationTCPStatusRejectsBlockedTarget$' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 53.4% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- The target-policy integration now proves blocked SOCKS5 UDP targets do not receive relay responses.
- The same test asserts UDP rejections are observable through both server logs and `x_tunnel_server_target_rejections_total`.

Post Phase 8 UDP datagram short-write checks:

- [x] Add a shared UDP datagram writer that rejects silent short writes.
- [x] Use the helper for direct UDP relays, upstream SOCKS5 UDP relays, and local SOCKS5 UDP responses.
- [x] Add focused tests for short writes, impossible over-writes, normal writes, and error propagation.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(WriteUDPDatagram|UDPAssociationHandleUDPResponseRejectsInvalidPort|UDPAssociationSendWritesBoundTarget|UDPAssociationSendDropsChangedTarget|WriteAllCount|WriteAllHandlesProgressiveShortWrites)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 53.7% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- UDP datagram writes now treat silent short writes and impossible byte counts as `io.ErrShortWrite`.
- Direct UDP relay writes, upstream SOCKS5 UDP relay writes, and SOCKS5 UDP client response writes share the same guard.

Post Phase 8 WebSocket frame short-write handling:

- [x] Add a counted `writeAll` helper so `net.Conn`-style writers can preserve bytes-written semantics.
- [x] Use the counted helper in `wsNetConn.Write` to complete progressive WebSocket frame short writes.
- [x] Return `io.ErrShortWrite` from WebSocket frame writes that stop making progress.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(WriteUDPDatagram|UDPAssociationHandleUDPResponseRejectsInvalidPort|UDPAssociationSendWritesBoundTarget|UDPAssociationSendDropsChangedTarget|WriteAllCount|WriteAllHandlesProgressiveShortWrites)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 53.7% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- `wsNetConn.Write` now uses counted full-write behavior while preserving the `net.Conn` byte-count return contract.
- The shared counted writer keeps the original `writeAll` API simple for protocol encoders.

Post Phase 8 SOCKS5 CONNECT target validation:

- [x] Reject invalid upstream SOCKS5 CONNECT `host:port` targets before writing a request.
- [x] Reject local SOCKS5 CONNECT empty or malformed domain targets before opening a remote stream.
- [x] Add focused tests for empty domain and invalid host targets.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(Socks5ConnectRejectsInvalidTargetPort|ReadLocalSOCKS5RequestMalformedReplyStatus|ReadLocalSOCKS5Request|HandleSOCKS5RejectsZeroConnectPort)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 54.2% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Upstream SOCKS5 CONNECT now rejects malformed `host:port` targets before writing any request bytes.
- Local SOCKS5 CONNECT parsing maps empty or invalid domain-style targets to a failed SOCKS5 reply instead of opening a stream.

Post Phase 8 local SOCKS5 request parser extraction:

- [x] Extract local SOCKS5 command/address/port parsing from `handleSOCKS5`.
- [x] Preserve existing SOCKS5 reply codes for bad RSV, unsupported ATYP, zero CONNECT port, and unsupported command.
- [x] Add focused parser tests for valid IPv4/domain/IPv6 requests and malformed request statuses.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(ReadLocalSOCKS5Request|HandleSOCKS5Rejects|HandleSOCKS5MethodSelection|HandleSOCKS5UserPassAuth|HandleSOCKS5UDPAssociate)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 54.2% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- `handleSOCKS5` now delegates command/address/port parsing to `readLocalSOCKS5Request`, keeping policy and dispatch logic separate from byte parsing.
- Parser tests cover IPv4, domain, IPv6, bad RSV, unsupported ATYP, zero CONNECT port, and truncated input.

Post Phase 8 wsNetConn adapter coverage:

- [x] Add a real `httptest` WebSocket pair helper for wsNetConn tests.
- [x] Cover binary frame writes and partial reads through `wsNetConn`.
- [x] Cover local/remote addresses, deadline forwarding, close signaling, and recorded dead errors.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'TestWSNetConn' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 56.0% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- wsNetConn now has real WebSocket adapter coverage for binary frame writes, buffered partial reads, deadline forwarding, address accessors, and close/dead signaling.
- The test uses `httptest` plus gorilla/websocket rather than mocks, so it exercises the same frame APIs used by smux channels.

Post Phase 8 CI parser fuzz smoke:

- [x] Add short CI fuzz smoke for the protocol hello parser.
- [x] Add short CI fuzz smoke for the SOCKS5 UDP packet parser.
- [x] Run both fuzz smoke commands locally plus full test verification.
- [x] Commit the workflow update with verification notes.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'TestWSNetConn' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -run '^$' -fuzz FuzzReadProtocolHello -fuzztime=2s -parallel=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -run '^$' -fuzz FuzzParseSOCKS5UDPPacket -fuzztime=2s -parallel=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 56.0% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- CI now runs bounded fuzz smoke for protocol hello and SOCKS5 UDP packet parsing after the normal race test.
- The local run did not create repository fuzz corpus files; generated interesting inputs stayed in Go's fuzz cache.

Post Phase 8 HTTP proxy hop-by-hop header stripping:

- [x] Strip `Proxy-Connection` before forwarding ordinary HTTP proxy requests.
- [x] Keep local consumption/removal of `Proxy-Authorization` in the same helper.
- [x] Update protocol docs for forwarded HTTP proxy headers.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage and run full verification before commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(StripHTTPProxyHeaders|HandleHTTP|HTTPProxyTarget)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 56.1% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Ordinary HTTP proxy requests now remove locally consumed `Proxy-Authorization`, proxy-only `Proxy-Connection`, fields named by `Connection`, and common hop-by-hop headers before forwarding.
- `docs/protocol.md` now documents the forwarded-header boundary for HTTP proxy requests.

Post Phase 8 HTTP proxy header integration:

- [x] Extend local proxy auth integration to capture headers seen by the origin server.
- [x] Send a raw authenticated HTTP proxy request with `Proxy-Authorization`, `Proxy-Connection`, `Connection`, and a connection-named header.
- [x] Assert proxy-only and hop-by-hop headers are absent at the origin while end-to-end headers survive.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'TestIntegrationLocalProxyAuth$' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 56.1% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- The authenticated HTTP proxy integration now verifies the origin never sees `Proxy-Authorization`, `Proxy-Connection`, `Connection`, or a connection-named header.
- The same real request verifies an end-to-end header survives forwarding, so the cleanup is scoped rather than blanket-stripping request metadata.

Post Phase 8 protocol standards references:

- [x] Add stable standards references for SOCKS5, SOCKS5 username/password auth, and HTTP semantics.
- [x] Clarify that x-tunnel's documented local proxy behavior is derived from those references plus project-specific target-policy rules.
- [x] Run docs-focused verification and full tests before commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `rg -n "RFC 1928|RFC 1929|RFC 9110|target-policy|hop-by-hop" docs/protocol.md`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 56.1% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- `docs/protocol.md` now links the SOCKS5, username/password auth, and HTTP semantics RFCs used as external protocol baselines.
- The local proxy sections now separate standards-derived parsing from x-tunnel-specific target validation and policy checks.

Post Phase 8 ClientSession channel lifecycle tests:

- [x] Add a lightweight real `*websocket.Conn` helper for channel lifecycle tests.
- [x] Cover `addChannel` auto IDs, preferred IDs, and replacement closing the old channel.
- [x] Cover `removeChannel` ignoring stale channel pointers and cleaning `serverSessions` when the last current channel is removed.
- [x] Run focused/full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'TestClientSession(ChannelLifecycle|StreamLimitAccounting|LimitAllowsExistingClient)' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 57.0% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Client session channel lifecycle now has unit coverage for auto IDs, preferred IDs, replacement close behavior, stale remove protection, and final session cleanup.
- The test uses real websocket connections from the existing adapter helper, avoiding unsafe fake `*websocket.Conn` construction.

Post Phase 8 benchmark coverage refresh:

- [x] Add microbenchmarks for SOCKS5 UDP packet round-trips, HTTP proxy header stripping, and counted full writes.
- [x] Run a short benchmark pass plus full/coverage/race verification.
- [x] Record benchmark evidence and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run '^$' -bench 'Benchmark(SOCKS5UDPPacketRoundTrip|StripHTTPProxyHeaders|WriteAllCount)' -benchtime=100ms ./...`: pass.
  - `BenchmarkSOCKS5UDPPacketRoundTrip-8`: `245.4 ns/op`.
  - `BenchmarkStripHTTPProxyHeaders-8`: `459.4 ns/op`.
  - `BenchmarkWriteAllCount-8`: `2.962 ns/op`.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 57.0% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Benchmark coverage now includes today's SOCKS5 UDP packet, HTTP header cleanup, and counted full-write paths.

Post Phase 8 HTTP proxy Via header:

- [x] Add local HTTP proxy handling that appends `Via: 1.1 x-tunnel` to forwarded non-CONNECT requests.
- [x] Preserve existing `Via` values using standard header append semantics.
- [x] Prove CONNECT tunnel payload bytes remain opaque and do not get proxy-added request headers.
- [x] Add unit and real integration coverage for the forwarded `Via` behavior.
- [x] Update protocol documentation, run focused/full/coverage/race verification, and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `rg -n "Via: 1\\.1 x-tunnel|CONNECT tunnel payload" docs/protocol.md integration_test.go x-tunnel.go x_tunnel_test.go`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(AddHTTPProxyViaHeader|StripHTTPProxyHeaders)$' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -run 'TestIntegrationLocalProxyAuth$' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 57.0% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- Ordinary HTTP proxy forwarding now appends `Via: 1.1 x-tunnel` while preserving upstream `Via` values.
- The authenticated proxy integration proves the origin sees both upstream and x-tunnel `Via` values on ordinary HTTP, while CONNECT-originated request bytes stay free of proxy-added `Via`.

Post Phase 8 HTTP/WebSocket auth interop:

- [x] Accept WebSocket token authentication when the client offers the token inside a subprotocol list.
- [x] Parse local HTTP proxy Basic auth case-insensitively and tolerate normal optional whitespace.
- [x] Clear request close state so stripped `Connection: close` is not regenerated on forwarded HTTP proxy requests.
- [x] Add focused unit coverage and run full/coverage/race verification before commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
- `go test -run 'Test(WebSocketRequestHasToken|ValidHTTPProxyBasicAuth|SanitizeHTTPProxyRequestClearsCloseState|HandleHTTPRejectsProxyAuth)$' -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -count=1 ./...`: pass.
- `go test -cover -count=1 ./...`: pass, `coverage: 57.2% of statements`.
- `go test -race -count=1 ./...`: pass.

Review:

- WebSocket token auth now accepts a valid token anywhere in the offered `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` list while still rejecting partial or missing tokens.
- Local HTTP proxy auth now accepts normal Basic auth casing/whitespace variants, and sanitized ordinary HTTP forwarding no longer regenerates `Connection: close` after stripping hop-by-hop headers.

Post Phase 8 target hostname validation:

- [x] Reject non-IP target hosts that are not valid DNS hostnames before opening TCP/UDP tunnel streams.
- [x] Apply the same hostname validation to HTTP proxy authorities and local SOCKS5 CONNECT domain targets.
- [x] Add focused boundary tests and update protocol documentation.
- [x] Run full/coverage/race verification and commit.

Verification:

- `git diff --check`: pass.
