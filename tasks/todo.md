# x-tunnel Development Plan Until 2026-05-16 19:00 +07

Assumption: "today 7 o'clock" means 19:00 on 2026-05-16 in the current local timezone (+07). Current planning time: about 03:33, leaving roughly 15.5 hours.

## Objective

Improve x-tunnel from a working single-file prototype into a protocol that is easier to evolve, verify, debug, and harden without breaking current WS/WSS + smux + SOCKS5/HTTP/TCP forwarding behavior.

## Current Baseline

- Single Go binary in `x-tunnel.go` with client/server modes.
- Transports: `ws://`, `wss://`, optional ECH, smux multiplexing.
- Local client listeners: SOCKS5, HTTP proxy, TCP forward.
- Remote egress: direct TCP/UDP or upstream SOCKS5.
- Existing manual verification previously passed local SOCKS5 and TCP forwarding.
- Main gap: no automated test files, no protocol spec, and protocol messages are implicit in code.

## Time-Boxed Plan

### Phase 1: Protocol Spec and Risk Map, 03:35-05:00

- [x] Document current wire protocol in `docs/protocol.md`.
- [x] Define frame/header formats for stream open, TCP, UDP chunk, UDP reply, and ping.
- [x] Record current limits: target length <= 65535, chunk length <= 65535, TLS 1.3, token via WebSocket subprotocol.
- [x] Identify backward-compatibility constraints before changing bytes on the wire.
- [x] List concrete risks: missing version negotiation, weak error propagation, no automated parser fuzz tests, large single-file maintenance cost, limited graceful shutdown.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] Manual review that spec matches existing parser/writer functions.

### Phase 2: Test Harness First, 05:00-07:00

- [x] Add unit tests for `parseIPStrategy`.
- [x] Add unit tests for SOCKS5 auth/address parsing.
- [x] Add round-trip tests for `writeSmuxOpenHeader` and `readSmuxOpenHeader`.
- [x] Add round-trip tests for `writeChunk` and `readChunk`.
- [x] Add round-trip tests for `writeUDPReply` and `readUDPReply`.
- [x] Add round-trip and malformed-input tests for SOCKS5 UDP packet parsing/building.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] Add coverage around protocol parser edge cases.

### Phase 3: Protocol Evolution Foundation, 07:00-09:30

- [x] Add a versioned client/server hello on each smux session or stream without breaking current data paths.
- [x] Define capability flags for TCP, UDP, ping, IP strategy, and future compression/metrics.
- [x] Fail cleanly on unsupported versions/capabilities.
- [x] Keep compatibility path for existing behavior if possible; otherwise document the breaking point clearly.

Verification:

- [x] Unit tests for supported and unsupported version negotiation.
- [x] Local WS server/client tunnel smoke test.

### Phase 4: Reliability and Lifecycle, 09:30-12:00

- [x] Replace repeated magic timeout literals with config fields where practical.
- [x] Add listener/server context plumbing where it can be done without a large rewrite.
- [x] Improve reconnect backoff to avoid fixed retry storms.
- [x] Ensure goroutines exit on stream/session close in TCP and UDP paths.
- [x] Add clearer error logs for failed TCP/UDP target dial/open.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] Local connectivity smoke test for SOCKS5 and TCP forward.
- [x] Short reconnect test by killing/restarting local server.

### Phase 5: Security Hardening, 12:00-14:00

- [x] Add explicit config validation for listener and forward URLs.
- [x] Add safer token validation semantics and document token limitations.
- [x] Add optional target allow/deny CIDR or host rules if the scope stays small.
- [x] Review `-insecure`, fallback, and ECH interactions; make user-facing logs unambiguous.
- [x] Document recommended deployment modes.

Verification:

- [x] Tests for config validation and auth failure behavior where practical.
- [x] Manual unauthorized token test.

### Phase 6: Observability and Operator UX, 14:00-15:30

- [x] Add structured-ish log prefixes or counters for sessions, channels, streams, reconnects, and UDP associations.
- [x] Add a `-version` flag if build metadata can be added simply.
- [x] Improve help text and README examples for common modes.
- [x] Add a troubleshooting section for token mismatch, ECH failure, DNS failure, and no smux channel available.

Verification:

- [x] `go run . -h`
- [x] README/docs examples checked against actual flags.

### Phase 7: Refactor Only Where It Pays, 15:30-17:30

- [x] Extract pure protocol encoding/decoding into a small file/package if tests show a clean boundary.
- [ ] Extract SOCKS5 parsing/building helpers if it reduces single-file risk without broad churn.
- [x] Avoid broad architectural rewrites unless current changes become hard to verify.

Verification:

- [x] `go test ./...`
- [x] `go run . -h`
- [x] Local WS server/client tunnel smoke test.

### Phase 8: Final Verification and Review, 17:30-19:00

- [x] Run complete local test matrix:
  - [x] server `ws://127.0.0.1`
  - [x] client SOCKS5 listener
  - [x] client TCP forward listener
  - [x] HTTP proxy CONNECT if feasible in time
  - [x] token mismatch rejection
- [x] Record exact commands and results in this file.
- [x] Review diff for unnecessary churn.
- [x] Confirm docs match current behavior.
- [x] Prepare final summary with remaining risks and next development backlog.

## Scope Control Rules

- Do not change wire bytes before tests exist for the current format.
- Prefer compatibility and explicit negotiation over silent behavior changes.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible; no broad rewrite unless a narrower fix is blocked.
- If tests fail or protocol behavior is ambiguous, stop and re-plan before continuing.

## Candidate Backlog After 19:00

- QUIC/WebTransport transport option.
- [x] Metrics endpoint or Prometheus counters.
- [x] Config file support.
- [x] mTLS or stronger client authentication.
- Benchmark suite and load testing.
- [x] Windows/Linux/macOS release packaging.
- [x] CI workflow.
- [x] Automated local integration test.
- [x] Release build metadata script.
- [x] Protocol helper benchmarks.

## Review

Phase 1:

- Added `docs/protocol.md` as the current protocol snapshot and risk map.
- Verified with `go test ./...`: pass, package reports `[no test files]`.

Phase 2:

Pending for later phases: reliability/security changes, integration smoke tests, and final review.

Phase 4:

- Added config fields for reconnect max delay/jitter, DNS query timeout, ECH retry delay, UDP read timeout, and shutdown timeout.
- Replaced practical hard-coded DNS/ECH/UDP time literals with config values.
- Added exponential reconnect backoff with crypto-random jitter and unit coverage for base delay and jitter bounds.

- Log evidence: server emitted `stream=4 client=240e1179 channel=1 kind=1 target=127.0.0.1:19096`.

Phase 7:

- Extracted protocol constants and pure protocol encoders/decoders into `protocol.go`.
- Kept SOCKS5 helpers in `x-tunnel.go` for now because they are still interleaved with listener and UDP relay behavior; extracting them now would be churn without a cleaner boundary.
- Verified with `go test ./...`: pass.
- Verified with `go test -cover ./...`: pass, `coverage: 15.7% of statements`.
- Verified `go run . -h` and `go run x-tunnel.go protocol.go -h`: pass and includes `-version` and `socks5://`.

- CONNECT evidence: response contained `s_server -quiet -accept 19443`.
- Token rejection evidence: client logged `认证失败：Token 不匹配或未提供`; server logged `Token 认证失败，来源 IP: 127.0.0.1`.
- Diff review: protocol extraction is isolated to `protocol.go`; no wire-format changes were made in Phase 7/8.
- Docs checked: `README.md`, `docs/protocol.md`, `docs/deployment.md`, and `docs/troubleshooting.md` match the current flags and observed behavior.

Remaining risks/backlog:
