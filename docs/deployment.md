# x-tunnel Deployment Notes

## Authentication

Use `-token` on both client and server whenever the WebSocket listener is reachable by anything outside a trusted test environment.

The token is sent as a WebSocket subprotocol value, so it must be a valid HTTP token: ASCII letters, digits, and token-safe punctuation such as `-`, `_`, `.`, and `~`. Whitespace, commas, slashes, control characters, and non-ASCII characters are rejected at startup.

This is bearer-token authentication. Anyone who has the token can connect unless source CIDR filtering also blocks them.

## Source Filtering

Use `-cidr` on the server to restrict which client source IPs may connect:

```bash
./x-tunnel -l ws://0.0.0.0:18080/tunnel -token "$TOKEN" -cidr 203.0.113.0/24
```

`-cidr` protects the WebSocket entrypoint. It does not restrict where the tunnel may dial after a client is accepted.

## Target Filtering

Use `-allow-target` and `-deny-target` on the server to restrict target IP CIDRs.
Use `-allow-host` and `-deny-host` to restrict domain targets before DNS resolution:

```bash
./x-tunnel \
  -l ws://0.0.0.0:18080/tunnel \
  -token "$TOKEN" \
  -allow-target 10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16 \
  -deny-target 10.0.9.0/24 \
  -allow-host api.internal.example.com,*.svc.example.com \
  -deny-host bad.internal.example.com
```

Policy order:

1. `-deny-target` wins first for IP targets; `-deny-host` wins first for domain targets.
2. If any allow policy is set, the target must match the allow policy for its type: CIDR for IPs, host pattern for domains.
3. Host wildcards only support the `*.example.com` form and match subdomains, not the apex `example.com`.
4. Domain targets are still rejected when only CIDR allow rules exist because the server cannot prove the pre-dial domain belongs to an allowed CIDR.
5. Domain targets are allowed under deny-only policy unless the hostname matches `-deny-host`.

Decision table:

| Server policy | Literal IP target | Domain target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No target policy | Allowed | Allowed |
| `-deny-target` only | Rejected if the IP matches a denied CIDR; otherwise allowed | Allowed |
| `-allow-target` only | Allowed only if the IP matches an allowed CIDR | Rejected |
| `-deny-host` only | Allowed | Rejected if the normalized hostname matches a denied host pattern; otherwise allowed |
| `-allow-host` only | Rejected | Allowed only if the normalized hostname matches an allowed host pattern |
| CIDR and host rules together | Decided only by `-deny-target` / `-allow-target` | Decided only by `-deny-host` / `-allow-host` |

Host patterns are matched against the literal requested hostname after lowercasing and removing one trailing dot. These checks run before DNS resolution. They do not prove the final resolved IP for a domain, and they do not protect against an allowed domain resolving to an unexpected network.

## Resource Limits

Use `-max-clients` and `-max-streams` on the server to cap active client sessions and active smux streams per client session:

```bash
./x-tunnel \
  -l ws://0.0.0.0:18080/tunnel \
  -token "$TOKEN" \
  -max-clients 64 \
  -max-streams 256
```

The default `0` preserves legacy behavior and means unlimited. `-max-clients` counts active `client_id` sessions; existing sessions may still open additional WebSocket channels. `-max-streams` counts all active streams for the same `client_id` across that client's WebSocket channels, including short-lived hello and ping streams. JSON config accepts `max_clients`/`max-clients` and `max_streams`/`max-streams`.

## TLS, ECH, and `-insecure`

Prefer `wss://` with a real certificate for exposed deployments.

`-insecure` disables certificate verification in fallback TLS mode and automatically disables ECH. Treat it as a local debugging option, not a production mode.

If ECH DNS lookup fails, the client keeps retrying until it can load an ECH config or until you explicitly use `-fallback`.

## Runtime Timeouts

Default timeouts are conservative for local and small remote deployments, but exposed deployments can tune them explicitly:

- `-dial-timeout`: target TCP/DNS dialing timeout.
- `-ws-handshake-timeout`: WebSocket handshake timeout.
- `-reconnect-delay`, `-reconnect-max-delay`, `-reconnect-jitter`: client reconnect backoff. Set `-reconnect-jitter 0s` to disable jitter.
- `-rtt-timeout`: channel RTT probe timeout.
- `-dns-timeout` and `-ech-retry-delay`: ECH lookup timeout/retry behavior.
- `-udp-read-timeout`: server UDP relay read polling timeout.
- `-shutdown-timeout`: graceful HTTP server shutdown timeout.

JSON config uses underscore keys such as `dial_timeout`, `ws_handshake_timeout`, and `shutdown_timeout`.

## mTLS Client Authentication

For stronger client authentication, use `-client-ca` on the WSS server and `-client-cert` / `-client-key` on the client.

Server:

```bash
./x-tunnel \
  -l wss://0.0.0.0:443/tunnel \
  -cert /path/server.pem \
  -key /path/server-key.pem \
  -client-ca /path/client-ca.pem \
  -token "$TOKEN"
```

Client:

```bash
./x-tunnel \
  -l socks5://127.0.0.1:11080 \
  -f wss://example.com/tunnel \
  -client-cert /path/client.pem \
  -client-key /path/client-key.pem \
  -token "$TOKEN"
```

`-client-ca` only works on `wss://` server listeners. `-client-cert` and `-client-key` only work with `wss://` client forwards.

## Recommended Server Baseline

```bash
./x-tunnel \
  -l wss://0.0.0.0:443/tunnel \
  -cert /path/fullchain.pem \
  -key /path/privkey.pem \
  -token "$TOKEN" \
  -cidr 203.0.113.0/24 \
  -allow-target 10.0.0.0/8 \
  -max-clients 64 \
  -max-streams 256
```

For local development, keep the listener on loopback:

```bash
./x-tunnel -l ws://127.0.0.1:18080/tunnel -token local-test-token -cidr 127.0.0.1/32
```
